This repository is dedicated to the Computational Biology project: https://gitlab.ensimag.fr/galiezc/protein-structure-prediction. Using fasta data from the genomes of normal and mutated Salmonella bacteria, the mutation position is searched for. The algorithm is based on a statistical model and is applicable to SNP searches.

Jupyter notebook includes all necessary steps to find hyperparameters with some visualisation, as well as code for the basic algorithm and its testing. Pdf-file contains a detailed description of the solution of the problem.
